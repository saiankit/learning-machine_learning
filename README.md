# Gradient Descent Algorithm for Linear Regression
###### It is an optimization algorithm to find the *minimum of a function*. We start with a random point on the function and move in the *negative direction* of the gradient of the function to reach the *local/global minima*.

##### Learning Rate
###### The size of the steps by which we come down the function is called the learning rate.
